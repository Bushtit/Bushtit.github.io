A group for iOS and Mac developers who want to explore all that’s
new and fascinating in `Cocoa` development. Expect deep dives and
bleeding edge stuff.

<!--We meet in Beijing, and you can [join the Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Bushtit/) for updates on new events. If you don't happen to be
there, [catch the videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/bushtit).-->

If you are interested in speaking at a future event, if you or your organisation are interested in supporting or hosting an event, then please feel free to [contact us](https://meniny.cn/imprint/).
